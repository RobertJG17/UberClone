# UberClone
iOS App Project with Firebase API integration

An app that provides user/driver and MapKit functionality in order to create a working Uber clone.
The project has been integrated with cocoapods in order to properly function with Firebase--an API
used to manage user data. I added the project with about 70% functionality so I could not, unfortunately,
progressively show the app coming to life. However, I will make sure to commit important changes throughout
the remaining processes. This app came by way of Stephan Dowless's Udemy course--"Programmatic Uber Clone App". 
It is very informative and I recommend it to anyone interested in building complex apps for iOS. It omits the 
use of the storyboard and relies solely on programmatic implementation from beginning to end.
